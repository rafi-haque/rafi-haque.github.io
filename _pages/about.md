I am a first year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Texas State University focusing on Cybersecurity and Computer Networks. I got my B.S. in Computer Science from Khulna University of Engineering and Technology. I have experience in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Currently, I work in Dr. Mina S Guirgui's Security Lab investigating detection and prevention of attacks in Cyber Physical Systems.
